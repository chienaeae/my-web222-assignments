        Stepped out of my comfort zone and came to Canada to study at Seneca College, aiming to face
        more challenges at international companies. Additionally, I use my personal time to actively
        learn new web technologies and have a keen interest in open source projects. My hobbies
        include cooking, diving, and reading.

        <p>
          Experienced in front-end development around 1 year. I am passionate about creating popular
          projects that solve people's problems. Participated in a B2B project designed to address
          data integration challenges in my previous job. My teammate and I utilized TypeScript,
          ReactJS, and NextJS to develop an administrative website.

          Web development is a field that constantly evolves. I am currently focused on learning
          technologies I have less experience with, such as monorepos, GraphQL, and WebSockets.

        <h2>Backend</h2>
        <p>
          Experienced in back-end development for approximate 2 years. I maintained an e-commerce
          service for ticket sales. We use Go and MySQL as our main tach stacks. This project
          included mulitple components and integrating 3td party services. The hardest part of this
          job is to tackle concurrent issues such as tickets sear reservation, etc.

          I have experience of developing a rental-related software application. Its core feature
          was using web crawlers to collect the latest rental information from major Taiwanese
          rental websites and Facebook, providing real-time notifications to renters. The main
          technologies used in this project were Python Flask, Scrapy, and PostgreSQL.

        <h2>Devops</h2>
        <p>
          Although I have never held a DevOps position, in my previous roles, I frequently needed to
          automate CI/CD processes. In my backend role, I independently developed a crawler system.
          I am also familiar with modern deployment technologies such as containerization, and I am
          currently continuing to learn about Kubernetes and AWS cloud services.
