          Santiago is a shepherd residing in the hills of Andalusia, Spain. He desires of finding a
          treasure located close to the Egyptian pyramids. Despite initial self-doubt, Santiago
          comes to a decision to promote his flock of sheep and embark on the adventure to
          understand his dream.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the way, he encounters various people who affect his journey, such as Melchizedek, a
          mysterious old king; a crystal merchant; an Englishman reading alchemy; and a true
          alchemist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each character imparts awareness and existence lessons that help Santiago recognize the
          importance of pursuing one's <em>Personal Legend</em> and the connection of all life.

        <h2>Themes and Symbolism</h2>
        <p>
          One of the critical issues of <em>The Alchemist</em> is the idea of the
          <em>Personal Legend</em>. This term refers to an individual's future or lifestyles reason.
          The narrative shows that everyone has a personal legend, and achieving it's far the key to
          actual happiness and success. Santiago's adventure symbolizes the common journey towards
          self-discovery and the obstacles one must overcome to achieve their dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another important theme is the <em>Language of the World</em>, a mystical concept that
          represents a universal way of communicating through signs, omens, and intuition. During
          his journey, Santiago learns to trust his instincts and interpret the signs that guide him
          toward his goal. This theme highlights the importance of intuition and spiritual awareness
          in understanding the world and our place within it.

          This novel contains many profound philosophical ideas. One quote from Melchizedek, the
          wise king, is: "... when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to
          achieve it." This concept suggests that the universe helps those who pursue their dreams.
          It deeply resonates with readers and highlights the importance of perseverance and faith.

          During his time running at the crystal hold, Santiago learns approximately alternate and
          model. The crystal dealer tells him, "I&#x2019;m terrified of change, but I can&#x2019;t
          stand still." This lesson shows the actual-lifestyles stressful situations of embracing
          alternate and the increase that comes from stepping out of one's consolation location.
